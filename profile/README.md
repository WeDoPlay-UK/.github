# WeDoPlay UK Projects
This organisation holds the source code for internal systems at WeDoPlay. Projects are for the sole use of WeDoPlay employees, and any contributions made are to be for the improvement of internal processes. 

## Support
If you require support or adjustments to any of these projects, you must be a member of the organisation. Speak to the contact centre manager for more information.

## Maintaining
These projects have been designed and documented to support the current internal processes at the company. If these processes chance, it is likely these processes would also need to change along with them. 

The projects have been "future proofed", meaning they will maintain the necessary file and folder structure automatically. This means that, upon my departure from the company, there is no reason as to why the projects would stop working.
